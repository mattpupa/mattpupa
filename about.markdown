# About page

I'm an analytics professional with 10 years of experience, working mostly with digital products.I've worked with companies that are big, small, office-based, remote, public, private, and a bunch of other adjectives. I even spent a few years as a Crossfit coach.

I've spent 2020 expanding my skillset into data science, while also trying to build up my own consulting practice. I've really enjoyed both so far, and I'm looking forward to keeping the momentum going into 2021.
