**Product Summary**<br>

- It’s a SaaS business model, with Good/Better/Best packaging that starts with a 29$ tier, and graduates to custom pricing as more features and data needed
- Very user friendly UI
- 100+ data integrations and 250+ metrics that can be added into dashboards

**Homepage**

- Clean minimalistic homepage design with obvious calls to action
- Clear description of what the software does that can be understood by technical and non technical users
- Obvious pricing page that lists pricing

**Sign Up Screens**

- First step brings user to a pricing/packaging page that clearly outlines features
- Since a credit card isn’t required to sign up, there’s an opportunity to skip this page and reduce friction in the sign up process, unless trial features differ based on which package chosen

![Cyfe Sign Up Form](/assets/images/cyfe/cyfesignupform.png)
- Sign up process is lengthy, which is frustrating after seeing this screen that only asks for name and email and says account will be created
- Create Account button triggers and email confirmation and more questions
- There’s an opportunity to A/B test the space on the left that currently has a testimonial. Could either remove the content completely, or change the content

![Cyfe More Data 1](/assets/images/cyfe/cyfemoredata1.png)
- After confirming email, there are still questions being asked that add friction in the product experience. This friction could be eliminated by adding an overlay on the fourth login to get this data

**Dashboard Screens**

- 100+ integrations and 250+ metrics data point is appealing, and may be more valuable earlier on in the product experience.
- This should be A/B tested as a Homepage variant, or early on in the sign up process as a way to increase user interest
- Would rather see a more clear call to action in an overlay vs a general overlay like this one

- New dashboard page is great visually...very simple with clean menu options
- Could benefit from a step by step guide that helps the user build their first dashboard and configure their first widget
- The purple trial expiration banner is very invasive and unpleasant, as it pops up when any new page is visited. This could be A/B tested for a more gentle nudge

![Cyfe Dashboard Full](/assets/images/cyfe/cyfedashboardfull.png)
- Dashboard elements can be easily configured, moved, and removed
- Crisp visuals which are easy to read
- Timeline for trending doesn’t appear to be adjustable. If it is, it’s not intuitive to find

**Left Navigation Screens**
![Cyfe Add User](/assets/images/cyfe/cyfeadduser.png)
- Left navigation screens all simple and user friendly

![Cyfe Dark Mode](/assets/images/cyfe/cyfedarkmode.png)
- Option to change dashboards to dark mode is available as well
