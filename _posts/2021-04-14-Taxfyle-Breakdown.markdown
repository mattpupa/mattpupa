- Clean homepage design with obvious calls to action and a pronounced ‘Get Started’ button

**Pricing Page**

- Very informative page with clear details of each package, but extremely dense and requires user to scroll a lot
- Fluffy messaging takes up most of the screen on page load, so there’s an opportunity to A/B test page with that removed, which would expose more package information on page load.
- Metrics to compare would be **% of page visits resulting in a new account sign up as well as % of page visits resulting in a click of ‘get started’ on the page**

**Sign Up Screens**
![Taxfyle Sign Up1](/assets/images/taxfyle/signup1.png)
- Since there’s a ‘Sign In’ button on the homepage, there’s an opportunity to A/B test the sign up flow without this screen, which will reduce friction for account sign ups
- There’s not much value on this page other than the links to downloading the app. That could be placed somewhere else.

![Taxfyle Sign Up2](/assets/images/taxfyle/signup2.png)
- Short sign up form that only requires an email and password, with options to sign up via other platforms
- No distractions possible on the page

![Taxfyle Sign Up3](/assets/images/taxfyle/signup3.png)
- Second screen asks for a name and phone number to finish off account creation. Since there’s only a few fields, there’s an opportunity to ask for everything on 1 sign up form. Not much friction overall, but could compare 1 step sign up form vs the current 2 step form

**Welcome Screens**
![Taxfyle Welcome1](/assets/images/taxfyle/welcome1.png)
- First page design is very simple, with big clickable buttons for different needs. These will take user to tax filing flow
- Overlay message adds a little confusion to the experience, as it says ‘click here’, but clicking on the overlay doesn’t actually do anything
- Overlay also says ‘1 of 2’, but there’s no easy way to figure out what ‘2 of 2’ is

![Taxfyle Welcome2](/assets/images/taxfyle/welcome2.png)
- Youtube pop up for receipts seems very out of place in the welcome flow. First time users wouldn’t have receipts at this point, and it takes the user’s attention away from the core product experience.
- Seems unclear if it’s referring to receipts for the taxfyle filing, or receipts people may upload for tax purposes.

**Tax filing flow Screens**

- Tax filing flow screens are very well designed. Clear messaging, no distractions, and 1 step per screen
- There’s an opportunity to A/B test removing the ‘Tell us about it’ copy on each page, as it seems redundant, but it’s not harming the current experience as is

**Dashboard Screens**
![Taxfyle Dashboard1](/assets/images/taxfyle/dashboard1.png)
- Dashboard opens to another overlay that informs the user about preferences. ‘1 of 2’ with no ‘2 of 2’ still a little confusing

![Taxfyle Dashboard2](/assets/images/taxfyle/dashboard2.png)
- Dashboard has simple design, with clear tax requests listed with their status, dates, etc

![Taxfyle Dashboard3](/assets/images/taxfyle/dashboard3.png)
- Documents page opens with overlay that is helpful, but may not apply to every user
