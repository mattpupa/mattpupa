- There's an opportunity to AB test for more clarity on this page. The product so far is so clear that it can be easily understood by technical and non technical users. This page assumes technical knowledge. There’s no explanation of SDKs, NPM, or where this code should be installed. Could those elements be added in an AB test?

**Dashboard Screens**

- There’s an opportunity here as well. Purple line on top of ‘Awaiting session recordings’ pop-up keeps buffering. Since people are so behaviorally trained to wait for a buffering screen to eventually finish loading, having this type of pop-up is an interesting choice. Could an AB test remove that buffering line and say ‘Please go to setup guide to finish project setup’?

- Very clean UI with a clear to-do list for finishing project setup
Opportunity to AB test left side navigation. Does showing that many options distract users from finishing project setup? What if only a few options were showing until the project was 100% complete?

**Left Navigation Screens**

- Good flexibility in terms of handling errors and getting notifications
- Privacy settings could use DOM explanation for non technical users
- Easy to understand pricing grid with benchmarks for higher tiers, although the plan details get cut off on right side of browser if the user doesn’t have their browser in full screen mode
- Very easy to delete user data that has requested it
