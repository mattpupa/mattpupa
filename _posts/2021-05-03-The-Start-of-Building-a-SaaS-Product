I wanted to start learning how to build SaaS products for two reasons. First,
it would help me better understand the product development side of SaaS, which
could help make me a better product analyst. Second, it could be a way
for me to make some additional income. I've made progress on the former,
but the latter will still take some time.

I've tried learning to code before, and it never really stuck. I had been
writing SQL for years, but it never translated to python or JavaScript.
Thankfully, things have stuck this time around.

I took a data science certification last summer, and it was the most python work
I had done up to that point. I don't know if it's because it was my main focus
at the time, or something just clicked, but I finally was retaining how to code.
For loops, lambda functions, and object oriented programming were making sense.

Around that time, I found [Jordan O'Connor](https://jdnoc.com). He founded a
niche SaaS called [Closet Tools](https://closet.tools/). It's become quite
successful, and he's done it all by himself. He's written a few threads on it,
but his process has been simple. Use Jekyll for a front end static website
(HTML + CSS + JavaScript) and Firebase for a backend. What's the benefit of
building this way? It's insanely cheap. I think he said his monthly costs were
under $5. That was appealing to me. The Closet Tools site has a simplistic
design. Seeing it wasn't too intimidating. I thought I may be able to do
something similar, and incorporate python into a backend somehow. Maybe some
type of automation tool...I wasn't too sure at that point.

In December 2020, I officially started my SaaS journey. To say I'm happy where
I am now with it, is an understatement. It's still a minimum viable product
(MVP to those in the tech space), but it works. In my following posts, I'll
write about different parts of the process I've experienced up to this point.
I'll cover Jekyll, Firebase, Cloud Functions, and a few other things on my mind.
Once I get the posts caught up to now, I'll continue writing as I develop my
SaaS more. In my next post, I'll cover learning about Jekyll and static sites.
